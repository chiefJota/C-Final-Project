## Git Workflow
1. Open Git in folder
    * Right click in the folder and select 'Git Bash Here'
2. 'git status' to list changed files
3. Check that files listed are the ones you want to upload
4. 'git add -A' to add all files
5. 'git commit -m "MESSAGE"' to commit all files
    * MESSAGE is where you would put a good description of your commit
6. 'git push origin master' to push to the repo
